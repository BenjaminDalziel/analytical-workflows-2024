# Intro & Philosophy
Overall, this class is about designing and building good analyses for scientific research. You will work on your own research topic, with the statistical approaches that make sense for your work, in the programming language(s) of your choice. Overarching these specifics are a set of best practices that make science more effective, reproducible, and ultimately more fun, and these best practices are the topic of the course. These best practices are always evolving and there is always more to learn. The course developers/instructors (Mark Novak and Ben Dalziel) are excited to learn along with you this term.

### Tool you will need to get started (both are free and very widely used)
1. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Throughout the course we will learn and practice Git and Github for version control, pipeline development, and collaboration. _Git_ is a distributed version control system designed to manage projects of any size, with any number of collaborators (or no collaborators). _Github_ is a web-based platform for code hosting, version control and collaboration that works with Git. It lets you work on projects with others (or just with yourself, possibly across multiple machines) from anywhere. We will learn Git and Github in part by doing. To wit, the course ``lives'' on Github and we will be regularly interacting with it. It can seem overwhelming to start with, but after a bit of immersion many people start to feel like they would not want to do research without it.
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Most of our work in science involves generating and editing text, including coding for statistical analysis, and writing manuscripts. We will practice using Visual Studio Code for our workflows. It has many features that can make work more efficient and fun.

#### A note on tools
In a nutshell, the point of this course is to learn and practice the design, development and sharing of scientific analyses that involve reproducible workflows, including version control. There are many different pieces of software and platforms for doing this, and which one you use after the course is over will depend on your personal preferences and (to some extent) the type of work you want to do. In the course, we are going to focus on just one main pipline, involving Github Desktop and Visual Studio Code. The reasons for this are that this pipeline is very widely used and very stable. By all using the same platforms we can minimize time spent troubleshooting individual setups, and focus on the underlying ideas.
