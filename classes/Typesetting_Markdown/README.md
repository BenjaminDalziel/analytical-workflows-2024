# Typesetting with Markdown

Markdown refers to syntax that creates formatted text using a plain-text editor. This offers the speed and precision of writing plain text while allowing the end result to be nice and easy to look at. You can add links, and even figures, tables and equations, using Markdown. There are a number of [Markdown flavours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Some people even use it to write and typeset their manuscripts (as we will learn to do with LaTeX).  In this class we're going to learn enough to write clear README files for our GitHub repositories.

	- equations
	- links
	- tables
	- figures (e.g. your workflow diagram)
